\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
\subsubsection{General Purpose}
    The purpose of this document is to correctly analyze all requirements, goals
    and actions needed in order to correctly develop SafeStreets.\\
    \\
    SafeStreets is a crowd-sourced application that intends to provide users
    with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations occur
    (eg. traffic violations) and will help to maintain stability and order
    within the streets. A reporting system will also be available to police
    offices and municipality employees in order to allow them to analyze (and
    take actions accordingly) different areas of the city and assess which areas
    have the most violations committed in.\\
    \\
    The core application will focus on storing useful traffic violation data
    provided by users, mainly with the help of input forms and hard evidence
    such as images. At any violation input, SafeStreets will also store useful
    metadata such as date and time the violation was retrieved, geolocate where
    it is and update a city wide map highlighting the areas where violations
    happen.\\
    \\
    In addition to that, with the help of third parties (eg. municipality),
    SafeStreets will be able to retrieve the data given by such party and
    cross-reference them with its own data retrieved by users. By doing so, it
    will be possible to identify unsafe areas, assess which kind of problems
    happen more frequently and suggest possible intervention. It will also be
    possible for third parties (municipality and police officers) to
    automatically generate traffic tickets. This will be happening in order to
    cross-reference all available data in order to build statistics such as the
    most (or less) egregious offenders or the effectiveness of the SafeStreets
    initiative \subsubsection{Goals} Follows a list of all goals that will be
    reached with the SafeStreets initiative.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item G1: The system must allow all kind of users (both third parties
        and civilians) to correctly input (with hard evidence) traffic
        violations around the city;
        \item G2: The system must autonomously retrieve metadata from hard
        evidence useful to report and to all users;
        \item G3: The system must allow to create different clearance levels in
        order to offer different reporting systems to different kind of users;
        \item G4: The system will provide an efficient reporting system in order
        to highlight different violation categories through all parts of the
        city where the initiative is active;
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Scope}
With SafeStreets users can notify the authorities when traffic violations occur,
and in particular parking violations. Both user and authorities must register to
the application and agree that SafeStreets stores the information provided,
completing it with suitable meta-data. The whole system, because it tracks users
information, must respect the standards defined for processing of sensitive
information such as GDPR if it is used in Europe. The user sends the type of the
violation to the municipality and direct proofs of it (like a photograph). The
system runs an algorithm to read the license plate and also asks the user to
directly insert the license for a better recognition. Of course other
information are required, like the name of the street when the violation has
occurred, which can be retrieved from user's direct input or from the
geographical position of the violation (using Google Maps API). Both users and
authorities can highlight the streets with the highest frequency of violations
or the vehicles that commit the most violations. SafeStreets crosses information
about the accidents that occur on the territory of the municipality with his own
data to identify potentially unsafe areas and suggest possible interventions.
Because municipality could generates traffic tickets from the information about
violations SafeStreets should guarantee that information is never altered (if a
manipulations occurs, the application should discard the information). Such
features are made possible trough the use of two mobile applications(one for the
citizens and one for the officers on the field). The collected information are
sent to a back-end. All the services can also be accessed through a specific
web-site.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
SafeStreets is designed to be a completely new software applications. It uses
some already proven services (Google Maps, PlateRecognizer APIs and Ghiro
software) for its critical tasks. The software uses these services in order to
double check whether both addresses and license plates are correctly
standardized in order to be stored into the violations database and if the
collected hard evidence have been somehow manipulated or corrupted.\\
The system is composed of two different mobile applications: one for the
citizens that want to reports violations and one for the officers acting on the
field. It also provides a web site for third party users which allows them to
assess and analyze potential unsafe areas, thanks also to a powerful reporting
system.\\
Taken into consideration that the municipality could generate traffic tickets
from the input violations, the software will be critical when it comes to
handling chain of custody. The latter is assured to never be broken by not
allowing any kind of customer (user, PO or employee) to modify the reported
violation. Supposedly, when some traffic violations might be erroneous or do not
have any reason of existence, the inputting user can warn the responsible third
party by attaching a warning explaining why it should not be taken into
consideration. The systems also ensures the veracity of each violation and the
hard evidence attached to it by running a image manipulation detection software
(Ghiro, per instance). This process is used by third parties before the emission
of each ticket to the corresponding offender.\\
\\
A high-level class diagram can be found below, which provides a model of the
application domain. The most important classes (not all of those which will be
implemented once the software will be ready) are shown in order to define how
the different components of SafeStreets will be communicating with each other.
It is possible to identify two kinds of third party users: police officers and
municipality employees. The first ones will be given access to both mobile
application and web application; the latter will be provided access just to the
above mentioned web application which will help these users assess the veracity
of the hard evidence attached to the traffic violations and to further analyze
unsafe areas around the municipality.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.255]{Images/umlmodel}
    \caption{Class diagram}
\end{figure}

It is possible to notice that there are two actors that model the third party.
Police Officers and municipality employees have both access to a web version of
the application, since this version provides the tools for checking input
violations, emit traffic tickets and assess possible improvements to unsafe areas.\\
\\
We will now furtherly analize some critical aspects of the system with the use
of activity diagrams. Actual system functions will not be presented, just some
high level system main processes.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{Images/ActivityInputViolation}
    \caption{Activity Diagram: Input violation}
\end{figure}

It is easily understandable that for any unathorized user trying to access the
system (those who have not correctly signed up) is not possible to input any new
violation. Furthermore, the location retrieving and the plate recognizing
processes are a bit tricky. The system tries to execute both of them
automatically by calling the respective API from GoogleMaps or PlateRecognizer.
If one (or both) processes fail, the system recognizes the problem and asks the
user to input the missing piece of information. Once all information is ready,
everything is sent to a shared database and saved for future check by third
party employees (PO or ME). 


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{Images/ActivityCheckViolation}
    \caption{Activity Diagram: Checking violation}
\end{figure}

As it is mentioned by the description above this one, no user can access the system
without a proper username and password. What is interesting in this part of the
process, is the possibility to end the whole process only once the traffic
violation has been checked, which means that the hard evidence attached to it
has to be approved as not being counterfeited or else. A running version of the
Ghiro software has to be already installed on the machine which is accessing the
system through a web browser; if not, the system itself will automatically
redirect to the latest downloadable version of it.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The system has no hardware interfaces.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The system doesn't provide any API to external applications.\\
However some softwares part of SafeStreets is developed by other companies.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Google Maps API: for localization and creation of unsafe areas.
    \item Plate Recognizer API: for License Plate recognition.
    \item Ghiro: a digital image forensics tool used for find out if the image
    in the violation report is real.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The system only uses HTTP(more precisely HTTPS) as communication service.
HTTP/HTTPS is used for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User and third parties registration.
    \item Sending violations both to SafeStreets and to authorities.
    \item Using Google Maps API and Plate Recognizer API
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance requirements}
The system is provided to serve a great number of users and third parties
simultaneously. The back-end must be powerful enough to accept thousands of
requests at same time during all the day.\\
The front-end applications (mobile and web) don't have particular performance
requirements.
\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standars compliance}
With regard to the privacy, security for the mobile application and the back-end
is a big issue, so the whole project is subject to the the GDPR. Furthermore
it's a good practice to apply W3C's Standards to ensure intercompatibility.
\subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
Even if SafeStreets is a software-based service there are some hardware
limitations regarding the smartphones.
\begin{itemize}
    \item must be able to make HTTPS requests (connection to internet
    4G/3G/2G/Wi-Fi)
    \item must have on board GPS (mobile devices only)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Any Other Constraint}
%probabilmente da cancellare (Secondo me non ci sono, a parere mio)
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system must be able to run 24/7 without any interruptions. Only small
concessions from this requirement might be tolerated. The system must also be
fault tolerant. In order to exploit this last point the data saved on the
servers should be duplicated.
\subsubsection{Availability}
Maximum availability is a necessity because users should be able to report
violations 24/7. One or two days per year may be used for maintainance, so 
availability of 99\% is expected.
\subsubsection{Security}
User and third party provide data that contains sensitive information, so the
security aspect is of primary relevance.\\ Communications between user, third
party and SafeStreets must be encrypted and the database with all the data must
be protected from any possibile internal or external attack.
\subsubsection{Mantainability}
The system shoule be flexibile and easy to mantain. For this purpose the whole
system will be developed using a modular architecture. \\
Fixing and modifying the system will be easy with the modular architecture.

\subsubsection{Portability}
SafeStreets in order to be useful must be used by a very large number of people.
It is for this reason that third parties' registration website must be available
on the majority of browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, Microsoft
Edge and Internet Explorer 11).\\
Naturally the mobile application must be available on both Android and iOs.
