        \subsection*{\chapIntroduction[Chapter 1 - Introduction]}
        Gives an introduction of the design document. It contains the purpose and the scope of the document, as well as some abbreviation in order to provide a better understanding of the document to the reader.

        \subsection*{\chapArchitecturalDesign[Chapter 2 - Architectural design]}
        Deals with the architectural design of the application. It gives an overview of the architecture and it also contains the most relevant architecture views: component view, class view, deployment view, run-time view and it shows the interaction of the component interfaces. Some of the used architectural designs and designs patterns are also presented here, with an explanation of each one of them and the purpose of their usage.
        
        \subsection*{\chapAlgorithmDesign[Chapter 3 - Algorithm design]}
        Presents the algorithm design. It includes the most critical parts of the application and the algorithms designed to deal with them. All of the algorithms are written in pseudo code in order not to make any restriction on the implementation language and stay focused on the most important parts.
        
        \subsection*{\chapUserInterfaceDesign[Chapter 4 - User interface design]}
        Refers to the mock-ups already presented in the \RASD document.
        
        \subsection*{\chapRequirementsTraceability[Chapter 5 - Requirements traceability]}
        Explains how the requirements that have been defined in the \RASD map to the design elements that are defined in this document.
    
        \subsection*{\chapImplementationIntegrationAndTestPlan[Chapter 6 - Implementation, integration and test plan]}
        Identifies the order in which it is planned to implement the sub-components of the system and the order in which it is planned to integrate such sub-components and test the integration.
        
        \subsection*{\chapEffortSpent[Chapter 7 - Effort spent]}
        Shows the effort spent by each group member while working on this project.
    
        \subsection*{\chapReferences[Chapter 8 - References]}
        Includes the reference documents.
