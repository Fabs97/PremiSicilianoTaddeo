    \section{Implementation plan}
    SafeStreets system is composed by different subsystems:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MobileApp
        \item WebServerApp
        \item AuhtorityUserWebApp
        \item ApplicationServer
        \item SafeStreets DBMS
    \end{itemize}   
    All SafeStreets subsystems need to be implemented, tested and integrated
    using a bottom-up approach. With a bottom-up strategy it's possible to
    develop lower level components first and then to reuse them in order to
    create higher level elements. Bottom-up approach also allows better testing
    of all the different components. It's important to show a visible
    application feature during all the steps of the development.\\
    There also are some external subsystems: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Municipality DBMS
        \item Google Maps
        \item Plate Recognizer
        \item Ghiro
    \end{itemize}   
    All the external subsystems, of course, are not implemented and tested
    because are develope by other people and they can be considered trustworthy.\\
    It's useful to create a list with all the features, their importance for the
    customer and their difficulty of Implementation in order to have a better
    estimation of the order and the time needed to meet clients requirements.
    \begin{table}[]
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Importance for the customer}  & \textbf{Implementation difficulty}  \\ \hline
            SignUp and SignIn & Low  & Low  \\ \hline
            Signal a violation & High  & High  \\ \hline
            Manage previous reports & Medium  & Medium  \\ \hline
            Visualize unsafe areas & High & High  \\ \hline
            Manage Account Settings & High & Low  \\ \hline
            Violation Checking & High & High  \\ \hline
            Visualize Statistics & High & High  \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    
    \section{Integration and testing}
    In order to start the integration testing process and to produce meaningful results, there are a number of 
    conditions on the progress of the development of the project that have to be met. As a matter of fact the 
    integration process should start only when the estimated percentage of completion of every component with 
    respect to its functionalities is:
    \begin{table}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Feature Of Component} & \textbf{Implementation percentage} & \textbf{Comments}\\ \hline
            Accountmanager & 90-95 & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}The functionality of 'Manage Account Settings'
                is important for the user but we can see it as an extra accessory that does not affect the other features of the 
                system, and for this reason the corresponding component 'AccountManager' can be implemented and
                tested later than the others.\\\end{minipage} \\\hline
            SignUpManager and SignInManager & 80-90 & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}The sign up and sign in features are 
                obviously an entry condition for the right functioning of the system, but they are not core features 
                and they are not very complex, so the testing and implementation of his corresponding components 
                'SignUpManager' and 'SignInManager' can be delayed. \\\end{minipage} \\\hline
            StatisticsManager & 50-60 & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}The functionality of 'Visualize Statistics' needs to be 
                implemented all the part relating to the reporting and management of them, so its entry percentage can be subsequent 
                to the previous one. The component 'StatisticsManager' can just postpone a bit its testing.\\\end{minipage} \\\hline
            UnsafeAreasManager and CrossDataManager & 50-60 & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}The functionality of 'Visualize Unsafe Areas'
                has the same role of the previous one, but instead about the Director it's about the Municipal Employee. The components 
                'UnsafeAreasManager' and 'CrossDataManager' can just postpone a bit its testing.\\\end{minipage} \\\hline
            ViolationsListManager & 20-30 & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}The functionality of 'Manage Previous Reports' it's important
                both for the users and for the authorities. The authority needs this component to do his job and the user needs this component
                to track his signalations. So this component needs to be implemented before ViolationsCheckingManager and to be tested as soon
                as possible.\\\end{minipage} \\\hline
            ViolationsCheckingManager & 10-20 & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}The functionality of 'Violation Checking' is very important and 
                affect many other features, so it's crucial to implement and test it. The component 'ViolationCheckingManager' it's hard to 
                implement and it needs to be tested as soon as it is ready.\\\end{minipage} \\\hline
            SignalViolationManager & 10-15 & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}Signal a violation is the core functionality of the system and 
                without it most other features would make no sense, it requires an implementation and integration with other functionalities 
                as soon as possible. The component 'SignalViolationManager' is tested as soon as it is ready.\\\end{minipage} \\\hline
