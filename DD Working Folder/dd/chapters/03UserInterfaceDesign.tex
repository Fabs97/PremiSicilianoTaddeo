    \section{Interface mockups}
    Both the web and mobile mockups have already been presented in the RASD in
    chapter 3. \\
    Here three UX diagrams are presented in order to show how the User and the
    Authority User will navigate through both the mobile and the web
    application. It's important to underline that the mobile application is the
    same for both user and authority user: the app is going to recognize the
    different kind of customer that has been logged in and is going to show both
    different functionalities and screens.
