     \section{Interface mockups}
     The mockups have already been presented in the RASD in chapter 3. \\
     Here three UX diagrams are presented in order to show how the User and the
     Authority User will navigate through the mobile application and the web
     site. It's important to underline that the mobile application is the same
     for both user and authority user: the app shows different functions depending on the user type.
